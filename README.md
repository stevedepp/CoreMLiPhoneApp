> Thank you for taking the time to watch my video.  I started this morning with a goal to create an iPhone app that uses inferences trained by Apple API’s to classify random objects.  One thing I quickly realized is that Apple’s form of authentication prevents anyone from testing developed solutions on Apple hardware without developer identity.  As usual Apple has real people that communicate very well and that was sorted quickly.
